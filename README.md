## Documentation for Business Card

This project's main purpose was to allow the ability to share business information with others online. As we have business cards handheld, this allows us to share information with possible imployers far away. This solves the contact issue of distance and miscommunication. As my card shows my information, you are also able to click on the two headers at the bottom, email and my name - these will bring you to my linkedin profile along with an email draft open and ready to connect with me. As far as experience goes, this is my second HTML website as I've had to code a portfolio in high school.
For the detailed aspect, I used the font "Inria Serif" as it gives my site a sophisticated and clean look. The color scheme is very similar to my style as it matches past projects and even my portfolio. I believe the most interesting part of my site is the designed background. This screen is made to look similar to that of an Adobe Illustrator file, as it is a commonly used software program for graphic designers.
